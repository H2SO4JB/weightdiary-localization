Weight Diary - daily weight tracker

Simple and effective weight loss tracking.

Simply enter your daily weight and let Weight Diary estimate your progress and how long it will take to reach your goal. No guesswork or calorie counting required.

Our trend line cuts through the daily fluctuations in your weight so you know instantly whether you are on track. As long as the trend line is sloping downwards and most of your daily entries are below the line then you are losing weight. It is that simple.

Use our goal and calorie calculators to further plan your diet.
